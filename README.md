# JavaScript Projects
Some small projects I made to improve myself using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Change Background Color
Randomly changes the background color of the page by pressing the button in the middle of the page. The working logic is to assign random numbers to 3 variables called red, green and blue on the js side via the Math library and to assign random colors using the rgb function in css.

# Counter
This is a counter application. There are increase, decrease and reset buttons. The working logic is that there is a hollow element, and on the js side, this element is filled according to the increase, decrease, or reset buttons pressed by the user. The content of the number variable varies depending on the user and is written into the element on the html side.

# Cursor Animation
This is a cursor application. Colors change randomly as you move the cursor on the page. It is a CSS-oriented application. Working logic: After a certain time, its color changes randomly according to the CSS codes.
The screenshots are not very smooth, this is because you have to be very fast to take a screenshot while the color of the cursor is changing.

# Fetch API
This is a fetch API implementation. It is used to fetch data from an API site using fetch(). There are 4 different buttons, each of which is used to pull different data. The working logic is that it sends a request to the url with the fetch() function on the js side, fetches the data and prints it on the page.

# Google Meet App
This application is similar to the Google Meet application. When the "+" button is pressed on the page, a new user is added to the call and the page is shaped according to the front. When the "-" button is pressed, the last user is deleted and the page is shaped accordingly. It can be seen in the screenshots. The working logic is that when the number of users is 2, 5, or 10, the page is shaped as 2, 3, or 4 columns and the users are placed on the page accordingly. Adding elements was done on the js side and using the "display:grid" structure on the CSS side.
